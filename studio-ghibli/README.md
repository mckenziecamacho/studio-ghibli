# Studio Ghibli Website
Project Choice (Tell us which project you're doing!)
I will be using react and react router to make a Studio Ghibli Film Website.
API link: https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/

Project Description
My project will be a Studio Ghibli react website that showcases the Studio Ghibli filmography using the information from a Studio Ghibli API. The website will include 6 components. A header component that contains the navigation for the website, a homepage component which displays the homepage along with the search bar and button components to search for a Studio Ghibli film. There will also be a film card component which displays the film picture and contains the film info component so that when the image is clicked the user will be taken to a new page that contains the details of the film they selected.

Technologies Used: Git, Github, Github Pages, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, React Router
